# Decompose characters
def decompose_hangul(char):
    jamo = j2hcj(h2j(char))
    cho = jamo[0]  # 초성
    jung = jamo[1]  # 중성
    jong = jamo[2] if len(jamo) > 2 else ''  # 종성
    return cho, jung, jong

# Train 3 classifiers
cho_clf = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=7)
jung_clf = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=7)
jong_clf = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=7)

# Combine predictions
def combine_jamo_predictions(cho_pred, jung_pred, jong_pred):
    # 초성 + 중성 + 종성 → 완성형 한글
    pass
```

**Expected Outcome**:
